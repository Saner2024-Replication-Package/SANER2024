2,Collaboration to Solve Issues,User-User collaboration,Collaboration and discussion between users to reach solution,"T8491:""I’m a beginner as well but from what I have seen is that you would actually encode this word and then, as your tokenizer doesn’t have it, it would return you a list of tokens that corresponds to that word. then you would just do the average of the word tokens probabilities""",,,
,,Expert-User Collaboration,Collaboration and discussion between expert and user to reach solution,"T14815: ""Hello there :I realized what was wrong, and you can open a PR to fix it as well.
