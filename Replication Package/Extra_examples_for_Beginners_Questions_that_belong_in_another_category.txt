 Another example is when a user asks a question about Inference Endpoints in the beginners category: T42099: "I want to specify a hypothesis template when using the inference endpoint for zero shot text classification with the facebook/bart-large-mnli 2 model but I can not find any indication in the documentation as to how to do this". 
 Yet another example of this happened when the user was using the Accelerator API from the Accelerate library and was facing issues: T10967:"I’m training my own prompt-tuning model using transformers package...I’m training environment is the one-machine-multiple-gpu setup...However, the Accelerator fails to work properly...So what’s the reason? According the manual, I think Accelerator should be able to take care of all these things". This user also put the question in the beginners category.
